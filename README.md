### Description

The main item in this project is battleships, it is titled (battleship_against_comp.py). The game is single player against the computer. Both player and computer have 5 ships. The sizes of the ships are as follows: <br>
2, 3, 3, 4, 5 <br>
The player will take it in turns against the computer guessing to find the location of all the ships. The first one to do so will win (either player or computer). <br>
Other features on this project include <br>
Rock, Paper, Scissors minigame<br>
Password generator<br>
Minature version of battleships<br>
The extra items are there due to me having a play around with python to become more comfortable with the language.

### Battleships
There are two battleships games in this project. The first (battleship_single.py) was made as a refresher for me to get back into working with python. The objective is simple. The computer had hidden 5 single space ships on a 9 by 9 grid. The player's job is to find them all within 50 turns. <br>
The other one (battleship_against_comp.py) Is the main game. The player places five ships on a game board. The computer will to the same on their game board. Then the user tries to find all the ships whilst the computer does the same against the user. First one to do this wins.

### Mini-Projects
As it's been a while since I wrote using only python I decided to refresh my memory by creating mini extras to this project. The password_creator.py is a very basic password generator that will create a random 10 character long sequence in all caps that the users can use when creating accounts with various websites. <br>
Rock Paper Scissors was another mini project, It is player v computer, The computer will randomly generate an answer for each round, the player can either win, lose or draw depending on the computer output. <br>
The battleship_single.py was made as a mini game, it has already been described above.

### Issues
Of all the issues encountered during the creation of the project, the only one I haven't fixed is an issue with the mini version of battleships. If a user doesn't chose a space and instead leaves the guess field blank, It will cause the game to crash. I haven't fixed it as it was a test for the main project battleship_against_comp.py.

### Other
As stated several times, the main file is the battleship_against_comp.py. All other files are refreshers for me. <br>
I would like to thank my mentor Antonio Rodriquez for helping oversee the project.
<br> In this project there is a install for bs4. This install was going to be used in another mini project. It currently remains unused for now.
